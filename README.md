Hi buddy ðŸ˜Ž

I'm an electronics engineer. I'm currently working to increase my level of knowledge. I'm very interested in analog and digital circuits, especially analog, yes, I like analog more than digital! I don't like programming much!ðŸ¤”. In these fields, every dear person needed my help **I'm at your service** ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’™

In the beginning, I am looking to build a **10kW solar power plant**âš¡ for my house!

I'm thinking of having a solar power plant that can provide full electricity to a city of 300,000 people! Less harm to the environmentðŸ’š. If I can have an electric car. If I have the ability to make big changes, I can also encourage my country to become a developed country in terms of consumption and use of solar energy by all people and renewables. I always tell my family to turn off the extra light bulbs.
Electricity is a clean energy for everyone that flows in the veins of the Earth!
